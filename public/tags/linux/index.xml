      <title>Practical Emacs Tip #1: Meet the C-x z command</title>

      <description>The Emacs manual simply states that &amp;ldquo;Repear the most recently executed command&amp;rdquo;.
This command just repeats the last command with the last given set of arguments to that command (if any). No rocket science. Just simple Emacs!
By the way, before we start there is one more thing - Once you press C-x z, you can repeatedly press only z for the command to repeat itself! No need to press C-x again and again.</description>

      <description>tr - translate TR basically stands for translate. The man page says - translate or delete character. So tr is used to manipulate the byte stream provided to it. This command again is very powerful when combined with other commands. For example you want to rename files to lower case (thought there are other methods for this), or you want to change a (or a set of) character in a file or from a live stream, this is the utility you will need.</description>
