I hate installing new packages/frameworks just because I want to try it. Nothing is removed cleanly later and your OS is left with configuration files, user files, hidden directories and lot more trash created by this new package. I hate that!
Up till now, I had no option. I used to install, then remove and after a while lot of unwanted files would be lying here and there.</description></item></channel></rss>
