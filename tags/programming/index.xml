What you will need A feature controller A configuration for the feature Infrastructure to deploy canary releases (optional; if you like to play with fire without wearing gloves) Safely Rolling Out Change Create a configuration for the new feature with default value set to disabled. Write code for the new feature but behind this new configuration condition using the feature controller.</description></item><item><title>Fundamental Join Algorithms and IO Cost</title><link>https://s9a.me/posts/databases/2022-12-24-fundamental-join-algorithms/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://s9a.me/posts/databases/2022-12-24-fundamental-join-algorithms/</guid><description>Joins are integral part of relational databases and they are designed to do them well.
There are few considerations before we join two table which can make a lot of difference on the performance of the query - whether there is an index present, what are the sizes of table? Can one table be fit in memory or whether an external disk sort could be required to perform the join efficiently.</description></item><item><title>A brief summary of Google's Monorepo</title><link>https://s9a.me/posts/2022-12-21-about-googles-mono-repo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://s9a.me/posts/2022-12-21-about-googles-mono-repo/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ll first talk about the code repo and how Goole makes it work, followed by the pros and cons and in the end whether it&amp;rsquo;s needed today.
About Most of the code in Google is written in a single repository - taking mono repos to the another level. This article is a summary of another paper title Why Google stores billions of lines of code in a single repository published by Rachel Potvin.</description></item><item><title>Vagrant - Setting up and tearing down development environments on the fly</title><link>https://s9a.me/posts/2017-07-02-vagrant-setting-up-and-tearing-down-development-environments-on-the-fly/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jul 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://s9a.me/posts/2017-07-02-vagrant-setting-up-and-tearing-down-development-environments-on-the-fly/</guid><description>I try a lot of new things and this trying new things forces me to install something new.
