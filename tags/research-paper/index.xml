Spanner is a globally distributed databases, schematized semi-relational database. Data is replicated across datacenters and regions. The data is automatically sharded and distributed.
Server Organization A spanner deployment is called a universe. Given it manages data globally, there are handful of universes deployed. Universe is divided into zones. Zones can be added or removed and serve as an administrative deployment (a physical isolation).</description></item><item><title>A brief summary of Google's Monorepo</title><link>https://s9a.me/posts/2022-12-21-about-googles-mono-repo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://s9a.me/posts/2022-12-21-about-googles-mono-repo/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ll first talk about the code repo and how Goole makes it work, followed by the pros and cons and in the end whether it&amp;rsquo;s needed today.
About Most of the code in Google is written in a single repository - taking mono repos to the another level. This article is a summary of another paper title Why Google stores billions of lines of code in a single repository published by Rachel Potvin.</description></item><item><title>On The Turing Test</title><link>https://s9a.me/posts/2018-08-04-the-turing-test/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Aug 2018 04:47:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://s9a.me/posts/2018-08-04-the-turing-test/</guid><description>The Imitation Game or Turing Test has become the hallmark of the question - ‘Can machines think?’. Turing predicts that by the end of 20th century, machine would be able to think. Humans have been on moon after that and machines are still at the dawn of thinking. Thinking. The paper is philosophical one and ‘think’ is a vague term which cannot be determined in simple yes or no. Turing has therefore, given a method, a test through which we can assess if machines can think.</description></item></channel></rss>
