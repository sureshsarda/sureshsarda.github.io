I had to clean some data and the data was not normalized. In one of the columns, a single cell had multiple comma seperated values. I could not find out the distribution of how frequently the value was appearing without splitting these cells into individual cells of their own; creating new rows.
Example:
# Input data: EmployeeId, City 001, Mumbai|Bangalore 002, Pune|Mumbai|Delhi 003, Mumbai|Bangalore 004, Mumbai|Pune 005, Bangalore .</description></item></channel></rss>
