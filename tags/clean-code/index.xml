Lisp has atoms and attributes, where the atoms represented an real world object. OOP has evolved quite a bit after that. SOLID design principle were introduced that helped us craft a better software. I will not go in details of how these principles help us, there is already lot of material out there. Instead I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on some mistakes we do while implementing these patterns.</description></item><item><title>Memento</title><link>/posts/2016-08-11-memento/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2016-08-11-memento/</guid><description>Ever used an image editing software? We opened an image but it’s too sharp and the light is not good. We make some changes and still not satisfied, we make few more changes only to realize that the previous changes were better than these new! We want to restore to previous changes. If we were using a drawing sheet and paint brush, this task would be very difficult; perhaps impossible. But with softwares, that’s not a problem.</description></item></channel></rss>
