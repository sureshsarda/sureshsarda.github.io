Explanation This one is really simple. The question is:
Jim is off to a party and is searching for a matching pair of socks. His drawer is filled with socks, each pair of a different color. In its worst case scenario, how many socks (x) should Jim remove from his drawer until he finds a matching pair?
So Jim keeps removing socks from drawer, and the moment he finds a pair(repeat color) he stops.</description></item></channel></rss>
