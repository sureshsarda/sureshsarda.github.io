# Launch Configurations in VSCode

A primary difference between an text editor and an IDE (Integrated Development)
environment is that IDEs can launch programs. They can execute without
needing to execute the code from terminal. While VSCode is a wonderful
text editor, it provides a very customizable (although a bit old school) way to
run programs.

The configurations are controlled from a `launch.json` file that should be
present in the `.vscode` directory.

It should be noted that the other IDEs too provide a way to edit these file
directly from where they store it. Typically this is the project root.
Their approaches are not documented though and therefore are subject to change
without notice.
