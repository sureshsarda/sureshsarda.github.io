# How does the rating work?
1. You left the book after reading a few pages
2. You left the book after reading about half
3. You had to take efforts to finish what you started
4. You  were able to read effortlessly, but the book was either not something you would read again or the writing was average, or you didn't like few things about it
5. You couldn't keep it down
