## Finer Job Selection
In the <a href="http://sureshsarda.in/2016/07/18/weekly-unix-6-job-control/">previous</a> article we saw basics of job control but we skipped alternatives to select jobs. Consider the following job listing throughout this article.

```bash
$jobs
[1]   Running    find . -name *.xml > /dev/null &
[2]-  Stopped    cat /dev/zero > /dev/null
[3]+  Stopped    find . -name *.cc > /dev/null
```

### 1. Using job number
You can use the job number (the number in square bracket) to work on it. Jobs can be referred by job number using `%N` where `N` is the job number.
```bash
fg %2
```
will resume 2nd job in foreground

### 2. Using job execution command
Itâ€™s not required to know the job number if you are more comfortable with the execution command.

The following command will resume 2nd job (the one starting with cat in background)

```bash
bg %cat
```
Whereas this next one will resume the 3rd one in background

```bash
bg %?cc
```
Note the difference of `?` in first and second form. Without `?`, prefix is searched whereas with `?` substring is searched. In case there are more than one job matching, the command will report an error.

### 3. Selecting current and previous jobs
Current job and previous job can be referred using `%+` and `%-` respectively.

## Shorthand
A shorthand method to resume jobs in foreground and background exists. Following commands are just short-form of respective longer commands.

```bash
%N => fg %N
%N & => bg %N
```
