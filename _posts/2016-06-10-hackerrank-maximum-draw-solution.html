<h3 id="sec-1-1">Explanation</h3>
<div id="text-1-1" class="outline-text-3">
<p>This one is really simple. The question is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>Â Jim is off to a party and is searching for a matching pair of socks. His drawer is filled with socks, each pair of a different color. In its worst case scenario, how many socks (x) should Jim remove from his drawer until he finds a matching pair?</p></blockquote>
<p>So Jim keeps removing socks from drawer, and the moment he finds a pair(repeat color) he stops. To find the solution, let's start with an example and dig our way further.</p>
<p>Let's say he has 4 pairs:<br />
<code>Paris: a, b, c, d.</code><br />
<code>Socks: al, ar, bl, br, cl, cr and so on.. (l = left and r = right)</code></p>
<p>That means, he has 8 socks.</p>
<p>In the worst case, on a really bad day, he will take out socks of all different colors. Untill at last there is no unique color left! So total <b>unique colors = number of pair</b>. So the next sock after taking out single sock from all the pair is going to be repeated.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that in worst case he will draw <code>(p + 1)</code> sock where p is the number of pairs.<br />
It doesn't matter which pair complets. The only condition is pair MUST complete.</p>
<p>I'll leave it to you how many he will need to withdraw in the best case ;)</p>

<p>C'mon the answer to the best case stupid question is 2! On his lucky day..</p>
