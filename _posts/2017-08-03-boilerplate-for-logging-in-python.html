excerpt: Basic configuration of logger in Python. 4 lines to get you started
---
<p>This is how all my Python scripts look like when they start:</p>
<div>
<pre>import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

logger.debug('Log message')</pre>
</div>
<p>Nothing much but I prefer logging over print statements. Whenever I want to move this small script to larger project, I don't have to make lot of changes. Logging also offers more control over the messages and what messages to print or skip.</p>
