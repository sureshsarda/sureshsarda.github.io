title: The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know
permalink: /books/absolute-minimum-about-programming
---
This book is inspired from [an article by Joel Spolsky on Encoding][1]. This article got me wondering what are few more things every program must know or should lear when they are programming. So I started compiling a list of topics which I believe as a programmer you should be aware of. Few of these are taught in graduate courses but they were well hidden behind other topics which perhaps are not that relevant. Few of these are never taught in grad school but we are somehow supposed to know them or are only taught by a mentor at work.

I hope you will find this information helpful. I have tried to keep this book fun and since it is an ebook, I'm trying to keep it interactive.
