# Query MOdeling

Query is an integral part of a database - we will insert, update, delete the data using these queries. So it's paramount that we first take a stock of what we will need and try to model a structure that can represent all these things.

A simple select query but for all columns
    1. Select all columns vs selecting specific columns
2. Fetch records from multiple tables - join
