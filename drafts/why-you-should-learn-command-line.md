# Why You Should Learn Command Line?

1. Makes you explore the utility you are using. If you get stuck, you get into a habit of reading the documentation.
- You get exposed to open source code.
- We learn from watching. Watching how people have done certain things helps us learning - exposes us to new patterns, design paradigms

-  The fact that the barrier to writing throw-away programs is so incredibly low means that someone who knows how to program can just throw together programs to solve programs that they run into on an hourly basis.

- Linux is not an operating system, it's a mindset, it's an idea

- The commands are everywhere. I don't have to install it. The same reason I switched from Emacs to Vim.
    I don't have to install any third party software on each machine I want to debug.
