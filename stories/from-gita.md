# The story of Arjun and Duryodhan and why Krishna choose Arjun to tell Gita

Krishna had gone to Durydhona, but he said
> I know what is right, and I know what is wrong. But I cannot do it.


Arjun had a different reply.


Durydhona put it as a fact. Arjuna asked a question to how to correct it.

- Eliminate the other choices. That's how you decide. Remove them completely.
